-- 
-- RANK() : function assigns rank to all the rows within 
-- every partition. Rank is assigned such that rank 1 
-- given to the first row and rows having same value are 
-- assigned same rank. 
-- For the next rank after two same rank values, 
-- one rank value will be skipped. 
-- For instance, if two rows shareÂ­ rank 1, the next row 
-- gets rank 3, not 2.



-- DENSE_RANK() : 
-- The difference between RANK() and DENSE_RANK() 
-- is that in DENSE_RANK(), for the next rank after two 
-- same rank, consecutive integer is used, no rank is 
-- skipped. 


-- ROW_NUMBER() :
-- ROW_NUMBER() gives each row a unique number. 
-- It numbers rows from 1 to the total rows. 
-- The rows are put into groups based on their values. 
-- Each group is called a partition. In each partition, 
-- rows get numbers one after another. No two rows have 
-- the same number in a partition. This makes 
-- ROW_NUMBER() different from RANK() and DENSE_RANK().
