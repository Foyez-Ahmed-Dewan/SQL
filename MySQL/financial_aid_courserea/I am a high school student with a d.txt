I am a high school student with a deep interest in machine learning. Currently, I do not have a source of income to fund my education or any additional courses. My passion for this field drives me to pursue learning opportunities that can provide a solid foundation in machine learning, a skill that I believe will be crucial for my future academic and career goals. I have come across Andrew Ng’s “Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification” course, which is part of the Machine Learning Specialization, and it is highly recommended for its comprehensive and practical approach to teaching machine learning concepts.

Unfortunately, without financial aid, I am unable to enroll in this course due to my current financial constraints. Receiving financial aid will allow me to access high-quality educational resources and complete the course assignments independently, which is important for my learning and mastery of the subject. This course will not only enhance my understanding of machine learning but also provide me with valuable skills and knowledge that I can build upon in the future. This opportunity is crucial for me to advance my education and realize my potential in the field of machine learning, and I would greatly appreciate your support in making this possible.
